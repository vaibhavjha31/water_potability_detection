# water_potability_detection

The following research paper draws attention to the model I created using Machine learning in order to predict whether a sample of water is safe for drinking purposes.
Based on the concentration of heavy metal ions, conductivity, pH, Turbidity etc.
For this i have used decision tree classifier and search grid as an optimisation algorithm.
